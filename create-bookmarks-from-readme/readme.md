This folder contains some super hacky python code that will read the contents of 
https://github.com/acgeospatial/awesome-earthobservation-code/blob/master/README.md

and extract all the links (between '#start-here' and '#end' to a .html file that you can load into your browser)

See the example.html file as example output
