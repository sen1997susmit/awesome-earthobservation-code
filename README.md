The [#scenefromabove podcast](https://scenefromabove.podbean.com/) aimed to be a mix of news, opinion, discussion and interviews. I am no longer involved in the podcast, however it is still going<br>

## Latest news

I have written a blog post about how this repo came into being. It includes a video of a talk I gave about it AND a podcast episode devoted to it. http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk/awesome-earthobservation-code/

Please note that this is <b>not</b> offically an awesome list.

<b> Update March 2024</b> Added a load of STAC links and some opendatacube ones. I accept PR's and you get a mention in the contributors file.

<b> A note of caution </b> During the QC of links I note that the vast majority are 18 + months old or considerbly older. Some repos are retired and still visible, some code is > 10 years old. Tread carefully.

Annotations are based on the headers - and where available - on the github accounts

## Earth Observation Introduction

If you are not familiar with Earth Observation then these links may help set context before you start using data. I didn't initially aim at including links like these but if you are not familiar with Earth Observation then some good resources to get you going may help prior to diving into code.

- [Earth Observation Text books](https://www.eoa.org.au/earth-observation-textbooks) - Earth Observation: Data, Processing and Applications is an Australian Earth Observation (EO) community undertaking to describe EO data, processing and applications in an Australian context and includes a wide range of local case studies to demonstrate Australiaâ€™s increasing usage of EO data.
- [ESA newcomers guide](https://business.esa.int/newcomers-earth-observation-guide) - The aim of this guide is to help non-experts in providing a starting point in the decision process for selecting an appropriate Earth Observation (EO) solution.
- [The state of satellites](https://landscape.satsummit.io/) - The satellite systems we use to capture, analyze, and distribute data about the Earth are improving every day, creating bold new opportunities for impact in global development.
- [Landsats Enduring Legacy](https://my.asprs.org/landsat) - pdf download over 600 pages of remote sensing!

You may also wish to navigate a search of the terms `satellite-imagery` and `earth-observation` to get the latest list of topics that have these terms in their headers

- [satellite-imagery](https://github.com/topics/satellite-imagery)
- [earth-observation](https://github.com/topics/earth-observation)

Two excellent videos (approx 20mins) about `Earth observation` 

[I Couldn't Find a Video Explaining Satellite Images, So I Made One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy5qR0cBFGs)

[How Radar Satellites See through Clouds (Synthetic Aperture Radar Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMsCyEAOrh0)

Not sure the best place for data catalogs is but this is a good start if that interests you [Data Catalogs](https://github.com/opengeos/geospatial-data-catalogs)

## Open EO

OpenEO covers many of the bases, hard to know whether to break it into different categories, it has many components. At present I mention it here at the start only.<br>

- [Open EO](https://openeo.org/) - openEO develops an open API to connect `R`, `Python`, `JavaScript` and other clients to big Earth observation cloud back-ends in a simple and unified way.
- [openeo-processes](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes) - Interoperable processes for openEO's big Earth observation cloud processing [website](https://processes.openeo.org/)

## Remote Sensing.info

<b> All links have been changed - update your pointers Oct 2022 </b>

remotesening.info warrents its own section, the vast array of tools and processing software is incredible
[RemoteSensing](https://github.com/remotesensinginfo) - Short tutorials and reference to useful software tools for the acquisition and processing of remote sensed Earth Observation data
- [RSGISLib](http://rsgislib.org/rsgislib.html) - The Remote Sensing and GIS software library (RSGISLib) is a collection of tools for processing remote sensing and GIS datasets. The tools are accessed using `Python` bindings.
- [ARCSI](https://github.com/remotesensinginfo/arcsi) - Software to automate the production of optical analysis ready data (ARD) from Landsat, Sentinel-2 and others

- more to come..

## `Python` processing of optical imagery (non deep learning)

This section full of great code and projects related to processing optical satellite imagery with `Python` . This section is under review Sept 2020 and being split into further categories - please suggest groupings or re assignments if needed - the idea is to make the Python code examples here easier to find. Categories are highly subjective.

## Interesting Non EO parts other languages

This section is aimed more a data science/programming resources that 'might' be applicable to Earth Observation, that are <b>not </b>Python

- [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) - This is the online version of the Oâ€™Reilly book: Efficient R programming. Code is [here](https://github.com/csgillespie/efficientR)

## Data

I don't really want to add many data resources to this list as it creeps out of scope but this part contains some good data links [not necessarily EO]

- [Environmental_Intelligence](https://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence) - Data for Environmental Intelligence: A mega list of Earth System Datasets covering earth observations, climate, water, forests, biodiversity, ecology, protected areas, natural hazards, marine and the tracking of UN's Sustainable Development Goals
- [gibs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) - This is EO
- [awesome-gee-community-datasets](https://samapriya.github.io/awesome-gee-community-datasets/) - Community Datasets added by users and made available for use at large 

## A footnote on awesome

There are many awesome lists relating to 'Geo'. I use that term as widely as possible. This list is not meant to replace these lists. Earth Observation is still <b>way</b> behind the GIS world in terms of audience, reach, number of users etc. Things are changing though, by bringing these links together I hope you can see that there has been so much progress in the last 5 years. I do hope these links are helpful espcially to those who are new to Earth Observation, but also to people like me who with several years of experience think they may have seen it all - we haven't and there is still so much to learn. Earth Observation is not just an academic 'thing' or a basemap anymore, it forms the basis for a growing and diverse business environment. Lets embrace this.

Finally, I wanted to acknowledge a couple of awesome Earth Observation lists that you may list to check out:

- [Awesome Sentinel](https://github.com/Fernerkundung/awesome-sentinel) - curated list of awesome tools, tutorials and APIs for Copernicus Sentinel satellite data
- [awesome-remote-sensing](https://github.com/attibalazs/awesome-remote-sensing) - Collection of Remote Sensing Resources
- [awesome-Geospatial](https://github.com/sacridini/Awesome-Geospatial) - Long list of geospatial tools and resources
- [awesome-remote-sensing-change-detection](https://github.com/wenhwu/awesome-remote-sensing-change-detection) - List of datasets, codes, and contests related to remote sensing change detection.
- [Awesome Geospatial Companies](https://github.com/chrieke/awesome-geospatial-companies) - List of 500+ geospatial companies (GIS, Earth Observation, UAV, Satellite, Digital Farming, ..)
